# StartProcessing

Files with exercises for beginners

Processing can be used to make graphical programs. It is super easy to install and has pre defined functions which make it easy and fun to quickly make something cool. I made some files with exercises for beginners. 

If you don’t have Processing installed on your computer you can get it at https://processing.org/download/. 

Download the whole repository in GitHub as a zip and place the folder “StartProcessing” inside the processing folder. It should run if you place it beside the folder named “libraries”. 


About the exercises
———————————————————-
You will be introduced to something new in every exercise. Feel free to use what you have already learned to make your program cooler and personal! In the bottom of the files you will find instructions, make sure you read them properly. A good start is to run the program before starting to get a quick grasp. 

Recommended order:
 * Circle
 * Flower
 * Triangle
 * Circle game
